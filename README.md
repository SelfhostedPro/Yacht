## This applicaton has not been updated in a while, I have brought it up to date as much as possible for security. Under the "wicked-testdeploy" branch. But this will not fully build. 

## However, there is a new version at [https://github.com/SelfhostedPro/yacht-nux](https://github.com/Yacht-Docker-Container) that is almost complete.

## Yacht

Yacht is a container management UI with a focus on templates and 1-click deployments.

**I'm currently rewriting the backend in Typescript as an attempt to have a language that more people would contribute to. You can follow development of that [here](https://github.com/SelfhostedPro/yacht-nuxt).**

**Please note, that while we are rewriting the back end. The Yacht.sh website is outdated on its instructions, please visit https://dev.yacht.sh for now. The main Yacht.sh site will be updated with the new release.**

## Demo:

![Tempaltes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SelfhostedPro/Yacht/master/readme_media/Yacht-Demo.gif "templates")

## Installation:

Currently only linux has been verified as working but we are open to the idea of supporting windows eventually as well.

**Keep in mind, this is an alpha so the risk of data loss is real and it may not be stable**

Installation documentation can be found [here](https://dev.yacht.sh/docs/Installation/Install).

Check out the getting started guide if this is the first time you've used Yacht: https://dev.yacht.sh/docs/Installation/Getting_Started

**Yacht is also available via the DigitalOcean marketplace:**

**We can also be found on Linode**

*If you want something that's not planned please open a feature request issue and we'll see about getting it added.*

## Templating:

Currently Yacht is compatible with portainer templates. You'll add a template url in the "Add Template" settings. The the template will be read, separated into apps, and imported into the database. The apps associated with the templates are linked via a db relationship so when the template is removed, so are the apps associated with it. We store the template url as well so we can enable updating templates with a button press.

We recommend starting with:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SelfhostedPro/selfhosted_templates/yacht/Template/template.json
```

In templates you are able to define variables (starting with `!`) to have them automatically replaced by whatever variable the user has set in their server settings (ie. `!config` will be replaced by `/yacht/AppData/Config` by default).

## Notes for ARM devices

If you're on arm and graphs aren't showing up add the following to your cmdline.txt:

```
cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1
```

## Supported Environment Variables

You can utilize the following environment variables in Yacht. None of them are mandatory.

| Variable     | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PUID         | Set userid that the container will run as.                                                                                                                                              |
| PGID         | Set groupid that the container will run as.                                                                                                                                             |
| SECRET_KEY   | Setting this to a random string ensures you won't be logged out in between reboots of Yacht.                                                                                            |
| ADMIN_EMAIL  | This sets the email for the default Yacht user.                                                                                                                                         |
| DISABLE_AUTH | This disables authentication on the backend of Yacht. It's not recommended unless you're using something like Authelia to manage authentication.                                        |
| DATABASE_URL | If you want to have Yacht use a database like SQL instead of the built in sqlite on you can put that info here in the following format:`postgresql://user:password@postgresserver/db` |
| COMPOSE_DIR  | This is the path inside the container which contains your folders that have docker compose projects. (*compose tag only*)                                                             |

## Notes for installing Docker and Yacht on WSL2 platform under Windows

If youâ€™re running under WSL2 inside Windows, because of the difference in how permissions are handled. Your essentially inside of a Linux machine accessing a Windows file system. You will need to run after installation before adding the Yacht container:

```
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Additional information about this can be found in the [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

## Update button not working?

*If the built in update button isn't working for you try the following command:*

```
docker run --rm -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower:latest --cleanup --run-once <container-name>
```
