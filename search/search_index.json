If you're using Yacht alongside portainer you'll want to change the 8000 on the left of the : to 8001, then it will be available on that port on your host. Once you're at the login page you can login with the username admin@yacht.local and the password pass . Template Variables We'll setup template variables so that if you're using a template built for Yacht, you'll be able to have all of your files mounted in the correct places. Click on the Settings cog in the left sidebar and then click on Template Variables along the top. Replace the paths on the right with where you want each variable to be mounted. (This will typically be in your file shares if you're using a NAS). Add any additional Variables you would like and when you're done, hit save at the bottom. Adding a Template To add a template, click on the Folder icon in the left sidebar and then on \"New Template\". If you don't have a template added yet it'll recommend you add the one that I maintain for Yacht. Once you've entered a name and URL you'll click submit. Now that you're on the \"View Templates\" page you can click on the template you added to see all the apps included with your template. From the \"View Templates\" page you can also click on the 3 dots and from there you can update if there are any changes, view the template, or delete the template. Deploying from a Template Now that you have a template added let's deploy an application. Click on your template to view it. Then pick an app to deploy. You can click on view to see any details about the application. One you've got an app in mind click on deploy and you'll be taken to the deploy form.

Yacht provides an in browser docker-compose editor as well as a way to manage them easily via the projects tab in the yacht UI. The easiest way to get started is to find a project that you want to launch, then click on the + button in the projects tab to create a new project. This will create a new folder with your project name and write whatever you've put into the editor into the docker-compose.yml inside of that folder. By default, these are mapped in the container to /config/compose . You'll want to have a separate folder inside of /config/compose with the project name as the name of the folder (if you create your project via yacht this is taken care of for you). Yacht uses docker-compose via the sh submodule for python so it supports the latest versions that are available and you wont need to worry about mismatches.

Inside of the project folder you can put the docker-compose.yml file as well as any other files you need to pass through.

The easiest way to get started is to find a project that you want to launch, then click on the + button in the projects tab to create a new project. This will create a new folder with your project name and write whatever you've put into the editor into the docker-compose.yml inside of that folder. By default, these are mapped in the container to /config/compose . You'll want to have a separate folder inside of /config/compose with the project name as the name of the folder (if you create your project via yacht this is taken care of for you). Yacht uses docker-compose via the sh submodule for python so it supports the latest versions that are available and you wont need to worry about mismatches.","title":"Projects Explained"},{"location":"Projects/explained/#docker-compose-folder-structure","text":"The following is an example folder structure: Folder Structure compose \u251c\u2500\u2500 docker-pulls ### Project Folder### \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Docker_Hub_Stats.json \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.monitoring \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 docker-compose.yml ### docker-compose.yml ### \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 prometheus \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 alert.rules \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 prometheus.yml \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 prometheus.yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 opendistro ### Project Folder \u2514\u2500\u2500 docker-compose.yml ### docker-compose.yml ### The way this works is the Project will be named the same as the project folder.

When you view a project, the docker-compose file is parsed and you'll see all of the details of the project.","title":"Docker Compose Folder Structure:"},{"location":"Templates/templates/","text":"Templates Explained This page will go over building a template. The templates are all compatible with portainer v1 templates so you can always check that documentation too. All of the keys (type, name, title, etc.) are optional and will simply be blank if left empty. Single app templates will be surrounded by {} as is standard for .json files. Multi app templates with consist of multiple {} sections (separated with a , after the } (ie. }, ) surrounded in [] .
